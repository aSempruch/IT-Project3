Project was tested with Python 3.7

Python files are distributed among directories to allow for importing custom modules and reuse of code

TLDS1 and TLDS2 are simply importing the same ts.py module 
and executing it with different parameters

Execution from project root

TLDS1 server:
`python server/TLDS1.py`

TLDS2 server:
`python server/TLDS2.py`

AS server:
`python server/AS.py`
